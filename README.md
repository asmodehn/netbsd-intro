netbsd-intro
============

This project is aimed to provide a quick introduction to the NetBSD OS, using a document describing how to install and setup a full and clean NetBSD system in few minutes on your computer.

This is aimed to people who wants to learn how to use NetBSD, as a "crash-course". Although for end-users, Office-BSD (http://inst.aydogan.net) might be more appropriate.

The documentation will be divided in 3 main parts :
1) Basic Install -> Usual install of NetBSD
2) Software Packages -> How to install and use pkgsrc
3) Customization -> How to keep your NetBSD up-to-date, How to enable 3D HW Acceleration, etc.

The documentation contains some advises depending if you target your computer to be a server, a simple desktop computer, or a powerfull development/game platform.

The documentation is to be valid from NetBSD 3.0 and hopefully will be kept up-to-date along the evolution of NetBSD.

The documentation will come along with sh scripts completely free to use as you want to automate some usefull administration task.

  <title>NetBSD 3.0 Installation Quick and Clean</title>

  <subtitle>This document is aimed at gathering the best way to properly
  install NetBSD 3.0 on your machine, as quick as possible, with 3 sample
  configurations : server, desktop, development workstation</subtitle>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>

    <para>For the following, I assume that you have a broadband connection, so
    you are able to download easily the needed files.</para>

    <para>I also assume that you have a basic knowledge of BSD systems, and I
    pass some details. If something is unclear for you can refer to the <ulink
    url="http://www.netbsd.org/guide/en/">NetBSD Guide</ulink> which explains
    all the details you might need.</para>

    <para>However I will try to include as much details as possible so even
    "BSD-dummies" can install NetBSD.</para>

    <para>If there is any problem or you are not sure of what to do, just read
    the <ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/guide/en/">NetBSD
    Guide.</ulink></para>

    <para>If something is wrong in here, or if it needs to be improved, just
    send me a <ulink url="mailto:asmodehn@gna.org">mail</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The root is big enough with 256MB as nothing big gets written in
      it except the kernels which are usually less than 8MB.</para>

      <para>I personaly advise for a /var of 2GB size at least if you dont
      want to bother to much after installation about it. Many things get
      written in there by default. (logs, mails, pkg database, temp
      uncompress, etc.)</para>

      <para>The default for /tmp should be enough.</para>

      <para>Balance the remaining space between /usr and /home, depending of
      the number of user (/home bigger) and software installed (/usr
      bigger)</para>

      <para>Then you might want to add softdep on FFSv1 for /usr, and /home
      (not safe enough for /root and /var in my own opinion...)</para>

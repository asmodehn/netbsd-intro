The messages given are usually accurate, and people have worked a lot to make them as usefull as possible, so read them :-)</p><p>First you have to choose the language for the install, then your keyboard layout.</p><p>After that you have access to the main menu of Sysinst were you can choose what you want to do. Usually you will select "Install NetBSD" unless you are here for a specific purpose.</p><p>Now going for the installation, select "Full installation". (if you dont want to use X installed or some other specific requirements, go for the "Custom installation")</p><p>The geometry detected for your disk should be fine. Then you have to decide if you want to use the entire disk on only one part of it (in the last case, you have to edit the MBR).</p><p>Choose to update the MBR, unless you want to mess with bootloaders.</p><p>Now with the NetBSD partitions, the default one is the most scalable, as you will not need to modify your partitions, therefore it is quite suitable for simple setups like Server and Desktop. But if you still plan to resize your partitions be aware that you should not put less space than the indicated default as it is the usual minimum space requirement. A good idea is also to balance the space between /usr and /home, depending of the number of user (/home bigger) and software installed (/usr bigger).</p><p>But remember, there is no way that I am aware of to resize your partitions later, so, unless you really know what you are doing, you better keep the default setting, with only one big / partition.</p><p>After that you can check your disklabel. Everything should be ok here. If something looks strange to you, check the NetBSD guide to understand what a disklabel is used for.</p><p>Last chance to go cancel the install without harming your system...</p><p>Now your disk is being initialized and all the selected sets are installed.</p><p>Now you have to set your locale time zone. If unsure, or if you dont want to bother about timezones (likely if you have windows on the same machine with automatic ntp updates), set it to <span class="emphasis"><em>Universal</em></span>.</p><p>For the passwords, if you dont have any other machine around on the network to deal with passwords, I would suggest to use blowfish algorithm, as it should be more secure...</p><p>Also, defining the root password now will prevent you to forget it later on.</p><p>And as a root shell I would personaly go for ksh, just because of the autocompletion by default.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e124"></a>2.3.1.&nbsp;Server settings</h4></div></div></div><p>If you plan to have a server, and wants to modify the default partition setup, I would allocate more space on /var. I personaly advise for a /var of 2GB size at least if you dont want to bother to much after installation about it. Many things get written in there by default. (logs, mails, pkg database, temp uncompress, etc.)</p><p>You might want to add softdep on FFSv1 for /usr, and /home therefore the operation on heavy loaded file systems will be more efficient. You will be able to do that after the first boot just by editing your /etc/fstab file. However it is not safe enough to use it for /root and /var in my own opinion...</p><p>Here is an example on a 40GB of space :</p><p>4 GB / (more than enough)</p><p>2 GB swap (usually around 2x the amount of RAM - not really needed, but might be usefull for big apps)</p><p>10 GB /usr ( as 0.3 GB for the base + ~1GB for src and building the OS + ~4GB for pkgsrc and space to build big software like OOo 2 + 125MB for xsrc and space to build it )</p><p>2 GB /var (should be ok for quite a long time)</p><p>20+ GB /home</p><p>1 GB /tmp ( more than enough)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e145"></a>2.3.2.&nbsp;Desktop settings</h4></div></div></div><p>For a Desktop setup the default settings should be pretty fine :)</p><p>Just add more swap if you think your RAM might not be enough for the applications you want to run.</p><p>Also you might want to have your /home isolated from the rest of the system just in case of something going wrong on the disk...</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s01.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1.&nbsp;Prerequisites&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.&nbsp;First Boot : Setup the OS</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
